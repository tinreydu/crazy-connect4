Put your final project proposal here.

I want to create a Connect-4 type game. I can make it customizable so the user can select what size board they want and
how many pieces in a row are required to win. I also want to use Cinder to make a GUI for the game and the options.
There will be sound effects for when the pieces drop into place

We started off with tic tac toe, so this would be pretty similar to that, just a little bit more complicated. It also
seems fitting that I am ending on a more difficult version of our starting project.

By the first week, I want to have just the base game done, no graphic implementation yet. By the second week, I hope to
have the game working graphically. This would include sound and the animation for pieces falling. By the third week, I
hope to have the options menu working.

If I were to finish the project early, I could maybe try to implement a computer player if I have time. However, this
would probably take a very long time, so I would only attempt this if I finish everything by the 2nd week.
